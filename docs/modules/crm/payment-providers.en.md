# Payment { #payment }

Connect online payments or let customers pay on receipt.

Open **Settings → Payments**.

<span id="_2"></span>

## Creating a method { #creating-a-method }

1. Click **New service**, choose a provider, and enter credentials from its account. The name is shown to customers and must be unique.
2. Set a commission and payment deadline if needed. Commission increases product prices, excluding delivery; Alfa-Bank has no commission field. After the deadline, an unpaid order enters **Payment error** with a delay.
3. Under **Order fields**, configure contact visibility and requirements. Email is required for T-Bank and SBP (T-Bank), and for Tochka Bank when fiscal receipts are enabled. SBP is Russia's Faster Payments System.
4. Click **Save**. For a new service, **Save as active** enables it in all chains and disables other services of the same type. For testing, choose **Save as inactive**, then enable it in the [required chain](stores-and-delivery.md).

!!! warning "Secret credentials"
    Enter passwords, tokens, and secret keys only in CRM and the provider's account. Do not include them in screenshots or support requests. Use notification addresses shown in CRM without changes.

You can edit **Card on receipt** and **Cash on receipt**, but cannot delete them. A method used in orders cannot be deleted either.

Online payments in Tellem are available for orders in rubles. For another currency, use payment on receipt.

!!! warning "Online transfer"
    The app does not show payment details for this previously available method. Disable it in chains under **Catalog → Stores → Manage payment methods**. For an existing **New** order, agree on payment with the customer and click [Accept order](orders.md).

## Method order { #method-order }

In **Settings → Payments**, select a row and click **Move up** or **Move down**. On a phone, find these commands under **Actions**. The order is saved immediately and applies to all store chains; customers see only methods enabled in their chain.

<span id="_3"></span>

## Testing { #testing }

**Generate a test payment link** checks whether the provider accepts the credentials. Open the resulting page. The test link is not associated with an order and does not change a CRM order status.

Check the return to the app and status changes using a real order for an agreed small amount. Do not enable the method in all chains before this check.

## Request history { #request-history }

To investigate a payment, a CRM administrator opens **Settings → Payments → Request history**. Choose a connection, enter the exact order number or payment ID, and click **Apply and refresh**. On a phone, find **Request history** under **Actions**.

The journal contains requests to providers and incoming notifications from the last 48 hours. Select a record and open **Details** to inspect the request, response, or error. A connection test may have no order. Secret credentials, contact details, and payment links are hidden; large or unreadable content may also be hidden or truncated.

HTTP 200 means a response was received, but does not confirm payment. Check the order status. Notifications without a verified association with an order are marked separately. If you cannot see the history button, give the order number to a CRM administrator.

## Provider requirements { #provider-requirements }

Copy the remaining credentials from the selected provider's account.

| Service | What to check |
|---|---|
| T-Bank, SBP (T-Bank); Alfa-Bank, SBP (Alfa-Bank) | Optional order number prefix: Latin letters |
| Robokassa | MD5 is the supported hash algorithm |
| SBP (ArcoPay) | Choose a single-use or reusable SBP link |
| Sberbank, SBP (Sberbank) | Set **Notification checksum type** and **Notification verification key** so CRM accepts bank notifications |
| Beta Transfer | Set **Minimum payment amount** according to the provider terms. It limits the positive balance after redeeming bonuses and cannot lower the service's minimum in CRM |
| Tochka Bank, Tochka Bank (SBP) | [Obtain a token and select account details](#tochka) |

<span id="_5"></span>

## Provider notifications { #provider-notifications }

Copy addresses from CRM to the provider's account:

- **YooKassa:** **Details for personal account → Notification URL**; select `payment.succeeded` and `payment.canceled` events.
- **Robokassa:** on the same tab, use POST for Result URL and GET for Success URL and Fail URL.
- **Beta Transfer:** Result, Success, and Fail URLs are under **Additional information**.
- **Sberbank:** request the address from the Tellem team and enter it in the bank account. Without verification settings, CRM rejects notifications; the status updates on the next payment check.

T-Bank and ArcoPay receive the address with the payment. Alfa-Bank checks statuses without notifications. YooKassa status checks continue regardless of **Update payment statuses using the scheduler**.

## Tochka Bank and Tochka Bank (SBP) { #tochka }

1. In Tochka's account, open **Services → All services → Integrations and API → JWT keys**. Create an access token with permissions for the required product:

    | Product | Permissions |
    |---|---|
    | Card | `ReadCustomerData`, `MakeAcquiringOperation`, `ReadAcquiringData`, `ManageWebhookData` |
    | SBP | `ReadCustomerData`, `ReadSBPData`, `EditSBPData`, `ManageWebhookData` |

2. Paste the token into **Access token** without `Bearer`. A `client_id` or website builder login will not work.
3. Select the loaded account details: company and merchant for cards, or merchant and account for SBP. If lists are empty, check token expiry and permissions, test mode, and whether the bank enabled the product.
4. Click **Get** for **Public JWK for webhook**. This is the bank's public key for checking notifications. Copy **Webhook notification URL** into Tochka's integration settings and select `acquiringInternetPayment` for cards or `incomingSbpPayment` for SBP.

Before enabling **With fiscal receipts**, activate the service with the bank. The setting applies to new links and makes customer email mandatory. The receipt includes products with commission and delivery; redeemed bonuses reduce the amount.

Use Tochka's test credentials in **Test mode**. Before live payments, disable the mode, replace the token with a live one, and select the account details again. Then [test payment](#testing).
