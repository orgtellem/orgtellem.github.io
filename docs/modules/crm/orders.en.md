# Orders { #orders }

Find an order, check its payment and products, then move it through its statuses.

Open **Orders**. Search by order number, or select a status and fulfillment method in **Filter**. Collapsing the filter keeps the selected conditions; on a computer, you can also use column header filters.

On a phone, browse the compact list: each row shows the customer, status, total, fulfillment, and payment method. Open a row to view details: on a wide screen, they appear in a panel on the right over the table, keeping the table's width; on a small screen, they open in a dialog. To export to Excel on a phone, open **Actions**.

On a wide screen, drag the panel's left edge to change its width. While the section stays open, your chosen width remains when you switch orders or reopen the details.

Close the details with the close button in the header or Escape.

## Check the order { #check-the-order }

In the details, check the customer, fulfillment, products, and order total. Expand the comment when needed. Links open the customer and applied promo code. Additional product fields appear below the product card.

With iiko connected, check the **Selection** column for the dish size and selected extras, including quantities and extra charges. On a phone, the selection appears below the product name. See [iiko product setup](iiko.md).

“Products price” includes discounts and payment method fees, but excludes delivery; redeemed points have not yet been deducted. “Total price” includes delivery and deducts redeemed points.

??? example "Example: order total with a promo code and points"

    Example with demo data. The image shows the Russian interface.

    <figure markdown="span">
    [![The payment and total block of the order panel for an order with a promo code, delivery and bonus points: products 680 RUB, delivery 300 RUB, a demo 20% promo code, 150 points spent and a total of 830 RUB; the block is highlighted.](../../media/crm/crm-order-panel.en.png){ width="1280" height="720" loading=lazy }](../../media/crm/crm-order-panel.en.png)
    </figure>

In “Payment and total”, check the method and online payment state. CDEK and Yandex Delivery orders also have delivery information; Ozon and Russian Post orders do not. See [Delivery](delivery.md) for shipment actions.

## Statuses and actions { #statuses-and-actions }

Action buttons sit below the order information and remain available while you scroll. Choose an action and confirm the transition; the available buttons depend on the status. Custom statuses and transitions cannot be added.

???+ example "Example: a pickup order from “New” to “Completed”"

    Example with demo data. The recording shows the Russian interface. The store has one open warehouse, so an accepted order goes straight to “Getting ready”.

    <figure markdown="span">
    [![A pickup order: the New filter, the order details panel over the table, then Accept order, Order is pending pickup and Complete order with confirmation; the final status is Completed.](../../media/crm/crm-order-status-flow.en.gif){ width="960" height="540" loading=lazy }](../../media/crm/crm-order-status-flow.en.gif)
    </figure>

| Status | Action | New status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “New”, “Awaiting payment”, “Awaiting payment confirmation”, “Paid” | “Accept order” | “Pending processing” |
| “Awaiting payment confirmation” | “Confirm payment received” | “Paid” |
| “Pending processing” | “Distribute products”, then “Complete distribution” | “Getting ready” |
| “Getting ready” | “Send an order” for delivery, or “Order is pending pickup” | “In delivery” or “Pending pickup” |
| “In delivery”, “Pending pickup” | “Complete order” | “Completed” |
| “Completed” | “Return order” | “Returned” |

During distribution, select warehouses for all items, click “Manage products” in the window, then “Complete distribution”. If the sales area, meaning the order's store or chain, has one open warehouse, acceptance distributes products and immediately sets “Getting ready”, including for “Online” fulfillment.

??? example "Example: distributing an order between warehouses"

    Example with demo data. The recording shows the Russian interface. The chain has several open warehouses, so an accepted order waits for distribution in “Pending processing”.

    <figure markdown="span">
    [![A pickup order: after Accept order the status is Pending processing; in the distribution window the plus button next to the Samara demo store sets 1 and nothing remains to distribute; Distribute products, Complete distribution and Yes set the status to Getting ready.](../../media/crm/crm-order-stock-distribution.en.gif){ width="960" height="540" loading=lazy }](../../media/crm/crm-order-stock-distribution.en.gif)
    </figure>

If an “Online” order remains “Pending processing”, it can be completed without distribution. For CDEK and Yandex Delivery, carrier acceptance and delivery to the recipient set “In delivery” and “Completed”.

## Online payment { #online-payment }

An order paid through a link starts as “Awaiting payment”. The payment provider changes it to “Paid”, or “Payment error” if payment fails or the [payment deadline](payment-providers.md) expires.

!!! warning "Wait for payment before accepting"
    “Accept order” is available before payment. After acceptance, CRM stops updating the payment state and will not set “Paid”. If you accepted the order earlier, check receipt of funds in the payment provider's account.

“Awaiting payment confirmation” applies to “Online transfer”: check receipt and confirm it according to the [payment settings](payment-providers.md).

<span id="cancellation-and-return"></span>

<span id="_6"></span>

## Cancellation and return { #cancellation }

Before completion, choose “Cancel order”; after completion, choose “Return order”. Distributed products return to stock.

With one open warehouse in the sales area, confirmation returns products and sets “Canceled” or “Returned”. With several, choose where to return items in the return window and save.

“Canceled”, “Returned”, and “Payment error” are final statuses with no action buttons.

!!! warning "Refunding payment"
    Changing the status to **Canceled** or **Returned** does not itself refund the customer. For a paid order, arrange the refund separately using the original payment method; for an online payment, check the procedure and result with the payment provider. The order status does not confirm that money has been refunded.
